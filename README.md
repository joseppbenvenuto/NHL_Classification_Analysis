# NHL_Classification_Analysis

## Project Description

The analysis explored NHL team season data from 1983 - 2020 to predict season and playoff outcomes.

The season outcomes were calculated by how many adjusted wins a team won (wins + (ties / 2)) above the mean adjusted wins of any given season. The season outcome was calculated this way due to the varying nature of hockey; in some seasons, teams were closer in regards to games won and some had a greater divide. In addition, some seasons were longer than other seasons and by using the adjusted games a team won **(wins + (ties / 2))** above the mean adjusted wins of any given season metric, all seasons were included in the analysis despite some seasons having less games played (shortened due to strike and pandemic).

The season outcomes calculated in the way mentioned above will help predict and understand playoff outcomes more efficiently.

More than 60% of teams make the playoffs, so the analysis set out to predict teams that did not make the playoffs.

The entirety of the analysis sought to understand the statistical economics of what NHL team organizations can focus on to reach the post-season. 

By understanding the economics of what hold teams back from making playoffs, teams can gain more transparency and perspective on what does work with strategy and achieving successful campaigns in mind.

Achieving successful campaigns can potentially lead to increased revenue for all stakeholders through ticket sales, salary increases, endorsement deals, fair book value of the organization, greater economic activity for the represented city, etc.

## Methods Used

1) Descriptive Statistics - used for preliminary data exploration.
2) Machine Learning - in the process of predicting season and playoff outcomes, greater transparency around the features were developed for a greater understadning of the statistical economics driving teams into the playoffs.
3) Inferential Statistics - used to make quantitative recommendations (confidence intervals and means) regarding the predictor features.

### A/B Testing on Predictor Features

If teams want to make the playoffs they need to increase their aboveMeanAdjWins. To increase their aboveMeanAdjWins, teams should take into consideration the following:

**Note** - all p-values are significant as **p < 0.05**. 

1) **shootingPctg** -                strive to achieve **10.84%** shooting percentage and stay within range **10.3%, 10.48%, 10.67%**.<br>
2) **savePctg**                      strive to achieve a **90.21%** save percentage and stay within range **90.02%, 90.21%, 90.4%**.<br>
3) **savesPerGame**                  strive to achieve **26.12** saves per game and stay within range **25.82, 26.12, 26.42**.<br>
4) **failedShotsPerGame**            strive to achieve **27.17** shots per game and stay within range **26.91, 27.17, 27.43**.<br>
5) **winScoreFirstGreater61_low**    strive to win **82%** of games they score first and stay within range **75%, 82%, 88%**.<br>
6) **aboveMeanAdjWins**              strive to achieve **4.3** shots per game and stay within range **3.62, 4.3, 4.98**.<br>
